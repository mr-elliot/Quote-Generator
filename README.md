# Quote-Generator

Store popular technical quotes in database and retrieve it randomly by using Python3 and PostgreSQL with some basic web scraping technology.

Firstly create a database using pgAdmin4 and connect to the database and now run the file ```quote_gen.py``` it will take some time to complete.

Before getting disconnected from database the code prints some random quote from the table and its exit's.

This database can be used for printing some quotes in any website or page or as banner.
